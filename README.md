# 2048 Game

Description

2048 is a popular puzzle game in which the player must combine identical numbers to create the number 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 board, and each number has a value of 2^n, where n is the row or column number on which the number is located.

Rules

Players can move around the board using the arrow keys or by swiping on a mobile device. With each move, all numbers on the board shift in the same direction. If two numbers of the same value meet during the shift, they are merged into a single number with a value equal to the sum of those two numbers.

Objective

The goal of the game is to achieve the number 2048. If a player cannot combine any numbers, the game ends.
